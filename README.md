# React Native FlatList Renders Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The data is correctly populated in the component's state, yet the FlatList remains empty.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API endpoint. The API call is successful, and the data is stored in the component's state. However, the `FlatList` fails to render the fetched data, resulting in an empty list.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data state is properly updated, and the FlatList's `data` prop is used correctly.  Sometimes, async operations within useEffect may not trigger a re-render in time.  The `useCallback` hook can help prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensure data consistency.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe that the FlatList renders empty, even though the console shows successful API data fetch.

## Fix

The solution fixes this by ensuring the data state is updated and the FlatList correctly utilizes this updated data.  Check `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
